working notes on producing an episode of the Fatal Error podcast

## Audio Tagging

Import to iTunes and apply the following fields:

- Song name: `Episode N - Title`
- Artist: `Soroush Khanlou & Chris Dzombak`
- Album: `Fatal Error`
- Album artist: `Soroush Khanlou & Chris Dzombak`
- Genre: `Podcast`
- Artwork: _[podcast artwork](https://github.com/fatalerrorfm/artwork/blob/master/fatal%20error%20icon.png)_

iTunes will rename the file appropriately, and we're just using the resulting filename format for consistency.

## Audio Distribution

Copy the resulting, tagged MP3 from iTunes to:
- @cdzombak's archive
- the Audio Transfer Dropbox folder

And upload to Squarespace.

## Squarespace

Be sure to edit the audio block. In addition to including the title (`Episode N - Title`) and author (`Soroush Khanlou & Chris Dzombak`) in the Embed tab, fill out in the Podcasting tab:

- **iTunes Summary:** the first ("intro") paragraph of the show notes
- **iTunes Episode Duration:** the duration of the episode MP3 (in full `hh:mm:ss` format)

Allow Squarespace to show the Download link on the audio player, and set it to its Dark theme for consistency with the existing posts.

In the settings for each post:
- schedule for publishing on the right date, at 9AM Eastern
- turn on the switch for publishing to the twitter account, via the Social tab
